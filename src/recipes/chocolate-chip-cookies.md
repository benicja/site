## Chef's Secret Tips

- **The secret to perfect texture**: Don't overbake! The cookies should look slightly underdone in the center when you remove them from the oven.
- **Room temperature ingredients**: Make sure your eggs and butter are at room temperature for the best mixing.
- **Chill the dough**: For extra thick cookies, chill the dough for 30 minutes before baking.
- **Storage tip**: Store in an airtight container for up to a week, or freeze the dough balls for up to 3 months.

This recipe has been in our family for three generations, originally from Grandma's handwritten cookbook. Each batch brings back memories of baking together on Sunday afternoons!
