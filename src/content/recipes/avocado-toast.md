## Avocado Selection Tips

- **Perfect ripeness**: The avocado should yield slightly to gentle pressure but not be mushy
- **Color check**: Look for dark, almost black skin with no soft spots
- **The stem test**: If you can easily flick off the small stem and it's green underneath, it's ripe
- **Storage**: Keep ripe avocados in the fridge for 2-3 extra days

This became our go-to quick breakfast when we needed something healthy and satisfying. The everything bagel seasoning makes all the difference!
