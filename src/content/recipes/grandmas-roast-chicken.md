## Perfect Roast Every Time

- **Dry is key**: Pat the chicken completely dry for crispy skin
- **High heat start**: The high temperature creates beautiful golden skin
- **Use a thermometer**: Don't guess - 165°F in the thigh means it's done
- **Rest before carving**: This keeps the juices inside the meat

This was Grandma's go-to Sunday dinner recipe. She always said the secret was in the love you put into seasoning it. The whole house would smell amazing, and we'd all gather around the table for the best family dinners.
